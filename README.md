  #### DML – Manipulating Data (using INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE) :     
                              o Databse

                              o Functions (User Defined Functions, Table Valued Vs Scalar Valued) 
                              o Triggers (  FOR/AFTER INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE  
                                            INSTEAD OF INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE )
